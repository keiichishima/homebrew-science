# Homebrew/science (deprecated)
These formulae provided software tailored to scientific endeavours.

This tap was deprecated because it had different goals from the wider Homebrew organisation (e.g. Linuxbrew CI/support). All widely used, buildable formulae were migrated to homebrew/core.

If you wish to [migrate other widely used formulae](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-science/issues/6331) to Homebrew/homebrew-core please [submit a pull request](http://docs.brew.sh/How-To-Open-a-Homebrew-Pull-Request.html) there.

You may be interested in the [brewsci/bio](https://github.com/brewsci/homebrew-bio) and [brewsci/science](https://github.com/brewsci/homebrew-science) taps.
